<p>KeyValue Containers enable execution of queries that return scalar values and aggregates. KeyValue Containers work
    with entities of a special type named <code>KeyValueEntity</code>. This entity can contain an arbitrary number of
    attributes which are defined at runtime. KeyValue Containers are designed only for reading data, because
    <code>KeyValueEntity</code> is not persistent and cannot be saved by standard persistence mechanisms.</p>
