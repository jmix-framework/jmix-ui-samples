<p>The <code>ComboBox</code> component can handle user input if there is no suitable option in the list.
    <code>setNewOptionAllowed()</code> and <code>setNewOptionHandler()</code> methods are used for this purpose.</p>

<p>In this example, a new value entered by the user is added to the list of options and becomes available for later use.</p>
