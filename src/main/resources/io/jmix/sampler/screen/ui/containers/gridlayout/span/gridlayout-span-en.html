<p>Any component located in a <code>gridLayout</code> container can have <code>colspan</code> and <code>rowspan</code>
    attributes. These attributes set the number of columns and rows occupied by the corresponding component.</p>

<p>In this example, the <code>textField</code> located in row 2 and column 2 occupies three horizontal cells instead of
    one.</p>
