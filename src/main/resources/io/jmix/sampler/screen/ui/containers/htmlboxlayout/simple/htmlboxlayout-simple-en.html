    defined in an HTML template and then included in an application theme.</p>

    <code>id</code> attributes of XML-descriptor. Thus, the business-logic is defined in the screen XML-descriptor and
    Java controller, while the markup and enhanced design elements are described with the aid of HTML language.</p>
